JavaScript (JS for short) is the programming language that enables web pages to respond to user interaction beyond the basic level. It was created in 1995, and is today one of the most famous and used programming languages.

It was designed by Brendan Eich, and developed by Netscape Communications Corporation, the Mozilla Foundation, and Ecma International, first appearing on May 23rd, 1995.

The language was influenced by several high profile languages such as Perl, C, Python, and the original Java (no correlation).

In addition, many frameworks building on the JavaScript syntax have appeared to suit the growing needs of software and web development. Some popular frameworks include:

jQuery, a DOM-based framework designed for adding interactivity to web sites and supplementing client-side HTML. Angular.js, a JS framework that revamps HTML, to allow for the implementation of less power-intensive projects on the web. Ember.js, a framework used to build web applications, primarily focusing on the Bootstrap framework.

And many more!
